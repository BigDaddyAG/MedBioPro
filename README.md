# MedBioProject

#### This is the GitHub page for the project done during the Summer Term's course of Medical Bioinformatics at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin.


This project aims to
* build a workflow / pipelaine based on Apache Flink to analyze data from TCGA
* with three main components of the pipline being:
  * read in and preprocess data from the TCGA project
  * analyze the data using at least one machine learning and one network-based method
  * build a classifier that - based on input data - can distinguish two cohorts, e.g. "cancer vs. healthy" or "cancer sub-group A vs. cancer sub-group B" or similar
* run the pipeline on a flink cluster
